# Membrane

DISCLAIMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not use this code for practical situations! This MATLAB program is an oversimplified membrane design for an undergraduate project. The exit flow rates and compositions were calculated using very basic design parameters. This program was made public for those who want to see what a Level 0, perfunctory membrane design would look like :)


I recommend using a process simulator or writing a program that uses a much more accurate model (like the Maxwell-Stefan equation ) for membrane separation applications.

Now that I think about it, it's pretty pretentious of me to assume anyone will even check out my GitHub ;)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The purpose of this project was to design a separation process that purified a gas fuel stream containing methane, carbon dioxide,
oxygen and nitrogen. I chose the PBI/Matrimid (50/50 wt.%) membrane operating at 700â—¦C. Each component has a permeability constant (Qi) associated with the membrane. Assuming mass flux through the membrane is proportional to the partial pressure difference between the feed and the permeate of each component, Ji = Qi(Pfi-Ppi), the output flow streams and compositions can be calculated.
